# javasnake
to do:
  - Enabling different Board sizes
  - adding responsiveness to window size
  - Fixing the bug of a 2-length snake spawning (rarely appears when restarting the game)
  - fixing the inconsistent delay between game start and the first tick (timer is trying to trigger ticks even when the game is not active)
